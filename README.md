# Monetary Futarchy

Polkadot does not have a predefined issuance schedule by design. *Once the network launches and achieves relative stability*, it will be necessary to communicate clear expectations for the future issuance schedule to stakeholders. This module uses a chosen committee to relay clear expectations of future changes akin to the US Federal Reserve's DOT plot.

## User Story

* a committee projects a range for changes to issuance
* output a DOT plot with expectations
* record justification for each member

*maybe?*
* enforce collateral for relevant proposals in proportion to alignment with projections
* generalize to other decisions outside of issuance

This committee is doing substantial work that is vital to the system `=>` they should participate in the block reward scheme

## rules => decisions => accountability
